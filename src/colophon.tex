    \subsubsection*{Colophon}

    This book was typeset using {\LaTeX} and {Lua\TeX} with Markus Kohm's {\KOMAScript}.

    The text is set in Frank Grie√ühammer's Source Serif, an open-source font from Adobe.
    Titles, heading and other accents use Paul Hunt's {\sffamily Source Sans} from the same family.
    Code is set with {\ttfamily Source Code Pro}, from the same designer.

    The title page is of course set in {\panno\selectfont UGent Panno Text} by Pieter van Rosmalen, as required by our style guide.
    Originally developed for South Korean traffic signs, the Text variant was optimized for continuous text.
    Fun fact: the commercially available variant of Panno Text does include italic variants.
