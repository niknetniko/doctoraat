    \subsubsection*{Colophon}

    This book was typeset using {\LaTeX} and {Lua\TeX} with Markus Kohm's document class {\KOMAScript}.

    The text is set in Frank Grie√ühammer's Source Serif, an open-source font from Adobe.
    Titles, headings, and other accents use Paul Hunt's {\sffamily Source Sans}.
    Both were designed to work together, under the auspices of Robert Slimbach.
    Code is set with Paul Hunt's {\ttfamily Source Code Pro}, from the same family.

    Since Source Serif has no support for mathematics,
    the rare formulae are set using the Erewhon-Math package by Daniel Flipo.
    It traces its lineage to Slimbach's Utopia,
    a font that looks similar enough for the frequency it is used in this dissertation.

    The title page is set in {\panno\selectfont UGent Panno Text} by Pieter van Rosmalen,
    as required by our University's style guide.
    Originally developed for South Korean traffic signs, the Text variant was optimized for continuous text.
    Fun fact: the commercially available Panno Text does include italic variants.
